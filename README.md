Description: the goal of this project is to provide the necessary insights needed for the creation of a fintech solution, which will enable the Diaspora of a specific country to  to affect positively the development of their home country , by repurposing a percentage of the annual remittances towards impact-driven projects, therefore making diasporans investors in the economy. Too achieve that goal, we need to understand what is being done now, why it is done that way( why is it preferred?), undersatand the diaspora's motivations and interests, and ultimately what conditions are necessary to shift their behavior towards our goal.
