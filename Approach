For analytics purposes, this section describes the process and the types of analysis utilized to obtain the data, prepare and clean it, and to test the outcomes.
Some questions that we ask ourself when selecting a data source:
What data points are necessary to inform your analysis?
Do I already have access to this data, or must I find a dataset from another source?
Where are reliable and verifiable sources of this data?
How often is the relevant data collected and updated?
How is the data licensed for use, and is there a cost?
Is the data in a format that I can use, or convert to use, with my tools?
